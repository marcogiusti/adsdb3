adsdb3
======
Python 3 Advantage database interface
-------------------------------------

Disclaimer
==========

I am not affiliated with SAP SE and this driver is not the official ADS
Python driver.

This driver is still in alpha quality tho yet usable for simply tasks.
Most notably the ``callproc()`` does not support the output parameters.

Install
=======

adsdb3 itself is installable with pip_. If a wheel file exists for your
architecture and OS, you do not require a compiler and any header file.
Otherwise be sure to install a compiler and the header files for your
python version. In Debian, for instance, you need to install the
``build-essential`` and ``python3-dev`` packages.

At runtime adsdb3 requires the `Advantage Client Engine`_. Be sure that
the library ``libace.so`` could be find by the linker.

Test
====

adsdb2 include few test. ``test/test_dbapi20_adsdb3.py`` uses
``test/dbapi20.py`` from `Stuart Bishop`_ to check the compatibility
with the `Database API Specification v 2.0`_. To run them you need
access to a server and set either ADSDB3_DATASOURCE or
ADSDB3_CONNECTION_STRING environment variables. ADSDB3_DATASOURCE is
used only to set the DataSource connection paramenter along with few
defaults. With ADSDB3_CONNECTION_STRING you have control of the exact
connection string. Online you can find some example of `connection
strings for Sybase Advantage`_. The official documentation has a list of
`supported options`_ for the ``AdsConnect101`` API, but not all them
works with the connection string. I have still to figure out which work
and which do not. If you don't set any of those variables, the tests
that involve the server are skipped.

You have many options to run the tests. Most likely the easier is using
tox::

   $ tox -e py35-nocov

Programming
===========

adsdb3 is a DB-API2 compliant driver and it does not differ from many
other drivers. The tests are a useful source of examples. Just two
important notes apply here:

* always close the connections;
* always close the cursors.

Ex::

   from contextlib import closing

   with closing(adsdb3.connect(**params)) as connection:
      with closing(connection.cursor()) as cursor:
         cur.execute("EXECUTE PROCEDURE sp_mgGetInstallInfo();")
         print(*cur.fetchone())
